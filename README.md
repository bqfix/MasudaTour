# Masuda Tour

### Description
This app acts as a tour guide for the town of Masuda, Japan, and displays points of interest to the user.

This project was built for the Udacity Android Developement for Beginners nanodegree.


### What I accomplished in this project:

* Displayed a large amount of data to the user in an efficient manner.
* Implemented Viewpagers, tabs, and navigation drawers for movement options.
* Utilized implicit intents to access Websites for each location.
* Localized into both Japanese and English.
